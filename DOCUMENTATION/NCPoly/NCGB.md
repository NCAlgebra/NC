## NCGB {#PackageNCGB}

Starting with version 6.0.1 our legacy Gr√∂ebner Bases algorithm that
requires both Mathematica and auxiliary executables compiled from C++
to run has been completely replaced by [NCGBX](#PackageNCGBX).

See older versions of the NC documentation for a complete description
of the legacy C++ code functionality.
