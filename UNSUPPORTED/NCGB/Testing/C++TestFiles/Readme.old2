9/2

new runs of the test cases with amended C++ code


test.10

The answers are different between the C-code and the Mma-code

test.14

The Mma-code when given an empty list
gives back the answer from the previous run (if there is a previous
run).  The C-code gave back the empty list as desired.


test.16

Mma version and C versions give different answers.
Also,  When SetCleanUpBasis[1] and SetGlobalPtr[] 
are executed before MorasAlgorithm, we get an answer.
If those commands are not envoked, the C code
runs out of virtual memory.





test.21 22
The answers do not correlate between Mma and C
and neither answer is a subset of the other.  

test.23
C++ answwer is a subset of the Mma answer.

test.24
C++ answer is a subset of the Mma answer

test.35
the answers have some relations that are not common.

test.39 40
C ans is a subset of the Mma ansswer.


test.31  there is a problem with MultigradedLex.c
that wasn't a problem on previous runs.
