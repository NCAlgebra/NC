This directory contains tex and GB results from the test files c00.data.m 
through c78.data.m created by Bob, and the files c79.data.m through c85.data.m
which Eric Rowell created from problems given to us by Ben Keller.

The results came from running on surya with the path:
home/ncalg/NC/NCGB/MmaSource and ../NC/NCAlgebra
The LinkObject was /home/mstankus/CurrentDistribution/Binary/SOLARIS5.5/p9c_non,
1,1.

  The result of a test against /home/ncalg/NC/NCGB/Binary/p9c was true for 
all files.  This is the version of the code commonly used.
