The results in this directory have been cannonized by running NCGB 4.0.
    
Test c80.data.m, c81.data.m, c82.data.m failed according to the old
Pre2009 references and have been trusted after runnig NCGB 4.0. The
reason is due to a boggus copy of long rationals which were buggy in
the old NCGB version.

This directory contains tex and GB results from the test files c00.data.m 
through c78.data.m created by Bob, and the files c79.data.m through c85.data.m
which Eric Rowell created from problems given to us by Ben Keller.

The results came from running on surya with the path:

home/ncalg/NC/NCGB/MmaSource and ../NC/NCAlgebra

The LinkObject was
/home/mstankus/CurrentDistribution/Binary/SOLARIS5.5/p9c_non, 1,1.

The result of a test against /home/ncalg/NC/NCGB/Binary/p9c was true
for all files.  This is the version of the code commonly used.
