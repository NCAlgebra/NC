This directory contains two tests of NCGB and the many files need to run
them. The tests are called by loading

                   NCGBTEST
or running

                   GBTest[First,Last]


GBTest:  In directory MmaTestFiles there are 48 test files containing
input and answers from running an old reference version of
NCMakeGB[ ] on them. Then GBTest runs your current version
and compares answers to the reference.

NCGBTEST:  Runs your current version of NCMakeGB[ ]
and NCProcess[ ] on a collection of data files c.# stored
in TestProblems and compares to answers in the directory 
TestReference.
