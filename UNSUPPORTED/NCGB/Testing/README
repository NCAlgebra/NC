This directory contains two test routines for NCGB:

1. NCGBTEST
2. GBTest

and the many files need to run them. We now describe how to run these
tests.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. NCGBTEST

Run it by loading

 << NCGBTEST
 
NCGBTEST runs your current version of NCMakeGB[ ] and NCProcess[ ] on
a collection of data files c.# stored in TestProblems and compares to
answers in the directory TestReference. In directory TestReference
there are test files containing input and answers from running an old
reference version of NCMakeGB[ ] on them. Then NCGBTEST runs your
current version and compares answers to the reference. NCGBTEST is at
NCGB/Testing and loads problems from NCGB/Testing/TestProblems. It
stores the computed results in NCGB/Testing/TestResults.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. GBTest

Run it by calling the function

 GBTest[First,Last]

where First and Last are numbers of test files.

In directory MmaTestFiles there are 48 test files containing input and
answers from running an old reference version of NCMakeGB[ ] on
them. Then GBTest runs your current version and compares answers to
the reference. GBTest.m is at NCGB/MmaSource but loads problems from
NCGB/Testing/MmaTestFiles and (probably) NCGB/Testing/C++TestFiles. It
stores the computed results in NCGB/Testing/C++TestResults.
