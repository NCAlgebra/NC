(* NCDecompose *)
NCDecompose::usage = "\
NCDecompose[p,vars] gives an association of elements of the nc polynomial p in variables vars in which elements of the same order are collected together.

NCDecompose[p] treats all nc letters in p as variables.

This command internally converts nc expressions into the special NCPolynomial format.

Internally NCDecompose uses NCPDecompose.

See also: NCCompose, NCPDecompose.";

(* NCTermsOfTotalDegree *)
NCTermsOfTotalDegree::usage = "\
NCTermsOfTotalDegree[expr,vars,degree] returns an expression such that each term has total degree degree in variables vars.

For example,

    NCTermsOfTotalDegree[x**y**x - x**x**y + x**w + z**w, {x,y}, 3]

returns x**y**x - x**x**y,

    NCTermsOfTotalDegree[x**y**x - x**x**y + x**w + z**w, {x,y}, 1]

returns x**w,

    NCTermsOfTotalDegree[x**y**x - x**x**y + x**w + z**w, {x,y}, 0]

returns z**w, and

    NCTermsOfTotalDegree[x**y**x - x**x**y + x**w + z**w, {x,y}, 2]

returns 0.

This command internally converts nc expressions into the special NCPolynomial format.

(* NCCollect *)
NCCollect::usage = "\
NCCollect[expr,vars] collects terms of nc expression expr according to the elements of vars and attempts to combine them. It is weaker than NCStrongCollect in that only same order terms are collected togther. It basically is NCCompose[NCStrongCollect[NCDecompose]]].

If expr is a rational nc expression then degree correspond to the degree of the polynomial obtained using NCRationalToNCPolynomial.

NCCollect also works with nc expressions instead of _Symbols_ in vars. In this case nc expressions are replaced by new variables and NCCollect is called using the resulting expression and the newly created _Symbols_.

This command internally converts nc expressions into the special NCPolynomial format.

NCCollect[expr,vars,options] uses options.

The following option is available:

-   ByTotalDegree (False): whether to collect by total or partial degree.

NOTES:

While NCCollect[expr, vars] always returns mathematically correct expressions, it may not collect vars from as many terms as one might think it should.

(* NCStrongCollectSymmetric *)

NCStrongCollectSymmetric[expr,vars] allows one to collect terms of nc expression expr on the variables vars and their transposes without writing out the transposes.

(* NCTermsOfDegree *)

For example,

returns x**y**x - x**x**y,

    NCTermsOfDegree[x**y**x - x**x**y + x**w + z**w, {x,y}, {1,0}]

returns x**w,

    NCTermsOfDegree[x**y**x - x**x**y + x**w + z**w, {x,y}, {0,0}]

returns z**w, and

NCCompose[dec] will reassemble the terms in dec which were decomposed by NCDecompose.

NCCompose[dec, degree] will reassemble only the terms of degree degree.

The expression NCCompose[NCDecompose[p,vars]] will reproduce the polynomial p.

(* NCStrongCollect *)
NCStrongCollect::usage = "\
NCStrongCollect[expr,vars] collects terms of expression expr according to the elements of vars and attempts to combine by association.

In the noncommutative case the Taylor expansion and so the collect function is not uniquely specified. The function NCStrongCollect often collects too much and while correct it may be stronger than you want.

For example, a symbol x will factor out of terms where it appears both linearly and quadratically thus mixing orders.
