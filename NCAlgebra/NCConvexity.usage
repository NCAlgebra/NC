(* NCIndependent *)
NCIndependent::usage = "\
NCIndependent[list] attempts to determine whether the nc entries of list are independent.

Entries of NCIndependent can be nc polynomials or nc rationals.

For example:

    NCIndependent[{x,y,z}]

return True while

    NCIndependent[{x,0,z}]
    NCIndependent[{x,y,x}]
    NCIndependent[{x,y,x+y}]
    NCIndependent[{x,y,A x + B y}]
    NCIndependent[{inv[1+x]**inv[x], inv[x], inv[1+x]}]

all return False.

(* NCConvexityRegion *)
NCConvexityRegion::usage = "\
NCConvexityRegion[expr,vars] is a function which can be used to determine whether the nc rational expr is convex in vars or not.

For example:

    d = NCConvexityRegion[x**x**x, {x}];

returns

    d = {2 x, -2 inv[x]}

from which we conclude that x**x**x is not convex in x because x ≻ 0 and  − x⁻¹ ≻ 0 cannot simultaneously hold.

NCConvexityRegion works by factoring the NCHessian, essentially calling:

    hes = NCHessian[expr, {x, h}];

then

    {lt, mq, rt} = NCMatrixOfQuadratic[hes, {h}]

to decompose the Hessian into a product of a left row vector, lt, times a middle matrix, mq, times a right column vector, rt. The middle matrix, mq, is factored using the NCLDLDecomposition:

    {ldl, p, s, rank} = NCLDLDecomposition[mq];
    {lf, d, rt} = GetLDUMatrices[ldl, s];

from which the output of NCConvexityRegion is the a list with the block-diagonal entries of the matrix d.
