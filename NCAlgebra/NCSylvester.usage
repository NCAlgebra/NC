NCPToNCSylvester[p] gives an expanded representation for the linear NCPolynomial p.

NCPToNCSylvester returns a list with two elements:

-   the first is a the independent term;

-   the second is an association where each key is one of the variables and each value is a list with three elements:

    -   the first element is a list of left NC symbols;
    -   the second element is a list of right NC symbols;
    -   the third element is a numeric SparseArray.

Example:

    p = NCToNCPolynomial[2 + a**x**b + c**x**d + y, {x,y}];
    {p0,sylv} = NCPolynomialToNCSylvester[p]

produces

    p0 = 2
    sylv = <|x->{{a,c},{b,d},SparseArray[{{1,0},{0,1}}]}, 
             y->{{1},{1},SparseArray[{{1}}]}|>

NCSylvesterToNCPolynomial[rep] takes the list rep produced by NCPToNCSylvester and converts it back to an NCPolynomial.

NCSylvesterToNCPolynomial[rep,options] uses options.

The following options can be given: * Collect (True): controls whether the coefficients of the resulting NCPolynomial are collected to produce the minimal possible number of terms.
