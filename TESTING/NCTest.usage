NCTest::usage = "\
These are commands for automatically testing if our algorithms produce the correct answer. Problems and answers are stored under the directory NC/TESTING.

Members are:

-   NCTest
-   NCTestCheck
-   NCTestRun
-   NCTestSummarize

NCTest

NCTest[expr,answer] asserts whether expr is equal to answer. The result of the test is collected when NCTest is run from NCTestRun.

See also: NCTestCheck, NCTestRun, NCTestSummarize.

NCTestCheck

NCTestCheck[expr,messages] evaluates expr and asserts that the messages in messages have been issued. The result of the test is collected when NCTest is run from NCTestRun.

NCTestCheck[expr,answer,messages] also asserts whether expr is equal to answer.

NCTestCheck[expr,answer,messages,quiet] quiets messages in quiet.

See also: NCTest, NCTestRun, NCTestSummarize.

NCTestRun

NCTest[list] runs the test files listed in list after appending the ‘.NCTest’ suffix and return the results.

For example:

    results = NCTestRun[{\"NCCollect\", \"NCSylvester\"}]

will run the test files “NCCollect.NCTest” and “NCSylvester.NCTest” and return the results in results.

See also: NCTest, NCTestCheck, NCTestSummarize.

NCTestSummarize

NCTestSummarize[results] will print a summary of the results in results as produced by NCTestRun.

See also: NCTestRun.";
